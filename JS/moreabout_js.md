# **History Of JavaScript**
`Brendan Eich`, a Netscape Communications Corporation programmer, created JavaScript in September 1995. It took Eich only 10 days to develop the scripting language, then known as `Mocha`.


## JavaScript History Turns to ECMA

By 1996, JavaScript’s importance grew so much that it was handed over to an international standards scripting language body called `ECMA` (`European Computer Manufacturers Association`), which is responsible for the development and upkeep of this language to this day. As a result, the scripting language was officially given the name ‘ECMAScript’ (or ‘`ECMA-262`’), however people still call it `JavaScript`.

ECMA standards process runs in cycles – ECMAScript 2 was released in 1998,and ECMAScript 3 was released in 1999, which evolved into today’s modern JavaScript. Even though Microsoft proceeded to implement some of the proposals in their JScript language, it became clear that Microsoft would not implement JavaScript in Internet Explorer.

# ECMA Script Specification
The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.

* JavaScript is a **lightweight**, **interpreted programming language**.
* Designed for creating network-centric applications.
* Complementary to and integrated with Java.
* Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
* Open and **cross-platform**

## **Current Major JavaScript Engines**:

* `V8` — open source, developed by Google, written in C++

* `SpiderMonkey` — the first JavaScript engine, which back in the days powered Netscape Navigator, and today powers Firefox

* `JavaScriptCore` — open source, marketed as Nitro and developed by Apple for Safari
