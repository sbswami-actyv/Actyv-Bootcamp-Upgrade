# HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages by which you can creat your own webpages. Basically a web page consits of small units called elements that elements are actualy HTML elements . For example Button, Input box, Header, footer etc.
Have look on this image of web page this is including a heading in big letters and normal paragraph. So basicaly it is rendering a H1 tag for cretaing big sentence and P tag for paragraphs

Have a look on code for this page . Do not worry if you are not getting it we go to basics and then we look deep inside. Just look the structure only.

for example : 

     <!DOCTYPE html>  
     <html>  
     
      <head>  
       <title>Page Title</title>  
      </head>  
      
      <body> 
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>  
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>  
      </body>  
    
    </html>

Now let us understand each line : 

     <!DOCTYPE html>          // This tells browser that content is HTML
      <html>                  // This is wrapper inside which we write HTML element
        
        <head>                         // Head tag containing basic info abaut page
          <title>Page Title</title>    // tells title
        </head>                        //Head tag closing here
       
        <body>            // Body tag which contains main stuffs to make web pages
          <h1>My First Heading</h1>  // H1  tag for wrriting header of paragraphs 
          <p>My first paragraph.</p>  // P tag for wrinting paragraphs
        </body>           // Body wrapper closing
         
      </html>             //HTML wrapper closing


#  Basic Keys  in HTML

## Elements or Tags: 
Elements are smaller units of HTML for creating web pages. 
Here are some following elements which creates the web page for example input element header element, Footer elements, Button elements.
Following are some HTML tags :


    <a>           It is termed as anchor tag and it creates a hyperlink or link.
    <b>           It is used to make a text bold.
    <button>      it is used to create buttons
    <h1> to <h6>  It will create bigger letters words mostly for creating content headings
    <img>         It is used to insert an image within an HTML document.
    <input>       It defines an input field within an HTML form.
    <h1> - <h6>   Heading
    <p>           Paragraph
    <i> or <em>   Italic / Emphasis
    <b>           Bold
    <ul> & <li>   Unordered List & List Item
    <hr>          Horizontal line
    <div>         Mostly it works as wrapper.  We can create diffrent divisions by wrapping text images and buttons or more elements.

## Attributes 

Attributes are properties which we pass in tag or element. Attributes works as input to the elements and it sets the properties. 
For example : Let us take input element if we have to apply some styles then we can pass it as attribute to input tag like this :

    <input type = radio >
    <input input = radio >
    <input style = "height : 20px" >
    
  here in example `type` and `styles` are attributes . Similarly there many attributes like value, placeholder , etc.


 

## Block Elements Vs Inline Elements: 
**Block** Elements are those Elments which takes full width on screen. No any other tag can be put inside block tag in same line. As shown in figure.
Example :  div, P, h1-h6,header, footer

**Inline** Elements are those elements which do not take full width. As shown in figure
Example : span, input, button.

##   BOX MODEL

> (Let us understand how the "Briks" of a house behaves ) :

 Let us assum Bricks are HTML ELEMENTS and House is web Page.
Building block of of your house are "Briks". Similarly Building block of the what you see in app HTML elements. As you know some briks are having borders also and some briks are having some texts inside the border. Distance between the border and the text is call padiing. Now border is the ending no any material is available outside of the border of the briks. Now how much space it wants to take even after it is stable and fixed. Means if you are in you office the you create a distance betwwen other employess to sit similary that outer space after the border is called margin

![enter image description here](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/03/09/58/red-1119245_1280.jpg )

**Border**:  Bulged out area  which is wrapping the letter and crator
**Content** : Letter in the brik
**Padding**: Space Between Letter and border . From area where crator ends and border starts to the area where it touching the letter
**Margin** is the space around the brick  or outer area . See down side the brick, margin is zero for brick because It is totally touching the next three  down side brick without any space. So margin Bottom is 0 .  Margin top is some 5 or 6 units because there is some sapce between two briks on upper side
 No similarly compare this Brick to any HTML element. It will behave same as brick.

  ![enter image description here](https://www.websitenero.com/application/assets/img/html-module/box-model.png )

Increase in padding will increase the width and height because it will create space for inner text of the briks. Increasing the margin will not increase height and width but it will increase the sourounding space. So the bricks have lot of space get reserved for there outer surface.

## Structure Of Elements  

Now if you have to write any tages or elements then tag will have opening representation and closing representation . See in following figure.

![enter image description here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-web-design/9781449337513/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages2257977.png)

Let suppose if we have to use 'h1' tag then we have  write opening tag by writing  `<h1>` and then we have to close it by writing a slash `</h1>`. if we have to put or content in this to display  the we will put inside opening and closing of the tag.

 ## LINKS : 
 When we want user to go on pertical website after clicking some text or image then we have to provide link.
 This can be done by using "Anchor" tags denoted as `<a>`.  

     <a href="https://www.actyv.com/html/">Go to Actyv's Website</a>
     
 It will show the text  "Go to Actyv's Website" in blue color. Anchor tag takes  href attributes in which we pass the URL. If some one is going to clik that anchor tag then he will be redirected to that URL 
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):
-   An unvisited link is underlined and blue
-   A visited link is underlined and purple
-   An active link is underlined and red

## Image: 
Every website or web app contains Image. In web page or website if you want to add images then you ahve to use `<img>` tag.
For example: 

    <img src="picture.jpg">
    
This will include the image which you are goig to call locallly or remotely. If you want that image form remote then enter the url of the image otherwise you can enter the local image's path from your system in src attribute

## List
Lists are of two types

 1. Orderd List
 2. Unorderd List

**Unordered List** :  Unordered List starts with any symbols like circle or square or bullets as shown in figure.
![enter image description here](https://sapnesakar.com/HTML/lesson_12/ul_output.png)

To create the unordered list we have to use `<UL>`  and `<Li>`. So let just see how we  can use it. `<Li>` will contain the data items and `<ul>` will contain the  multiple `<Li>` or data as shown in figure 

    <ul>
    	<li>HTML<li>
    	<li>CSS<li>
    	<li>Js<li>
    	<li>Jquerry<li>
    </ul>
    
By default  it will show the circles. But we can change it by changing the style of list as follows.

    style="list-style-type:none;"

you need to add the upper line in `<UL>` tag like this:

    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
so it will show squares instead of circle. you can chage it as disc, circle, square or none.


**Ordered List**:  Ordered List starts with some numbers or alphabets Like this
 ![enter image description here](https://sapnesakar.com/HTML/lesson_12/ol_output.png)

To create the unordered list we have to use `<ol>`  and `<Li>`. So let just see how we  can use it. `<Li>` will contain the data items and `<ol>` will contain the  multiple `<Li>` or data as shown in figure 

    <ol type = "A">      //this type will decide that list will show A,B,C
    	<li>HTML<li>
    	<li>CSS<li>
    	<li>Js<li>
    	<li>Jquerry<li>
    </ol>

We can change the type like number,alphabet or roman by changing the type as follows

type = "A"  // for Alphabets
type = "a"  // for Alphabets in lower case
type = "1"  // for numbers
type = "i"  // for roman numbers

## Start Creating Web Pages 

1: Open any folder and create a file having file name index.html
2: Now type this code in that file and save it

  <!DOCTYPE html>  
     <html>  
     
      <head>  
       <title>Page Title</title>  
      </head>  
      
      <body> 
        <h1>My First Heading</h1>  
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>  
      </body>  
    
    </html>
3 : Now open that index.html file in browser It will show you. the follwing screen
