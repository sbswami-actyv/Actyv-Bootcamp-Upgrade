Learn CSS in one look

# Why CSS ?
If you create a house then it will require to set the orientation, size, height, location and other appearnig feature of the rooms.
You will also require to decide that on which floor your room should be and what should be the color of the each wall.
So CSS is not only a painting thing it decideds the orientation and all appearing design of the indivisiual app elements like button, text box,  images and all the things you see in a app

# Can HTML not solve this problem
No, HTML is just like the skeleton of the house. You can just put rows of briks(HTML) one after one but to align it in perticular direction or to make it appear like small or tall or colourfull you need CSS
Without CSS the app will be like a pdf document having text in each new line
If you write list of things in new lines then you cannot make it to appear in a single line or vice versa but CSS will give you the power to play with the orientations, animation and colors.

# Let us start

**After These 10 Concepts you will  be enough to mention CSS in your resume**


# 1 : BOX MODEL 
> (Let us understand how the "Briks" of a house behaves ) : 

 Building block of of your house  are "Briks". Similarly Building block of the  hwat you see in app  HTML elements. As you know some briks are having borders also and some briks are having some texts inside the border. Distance between the border and the text is call padiing. Now border is the ending no any material is available outside of the border of the briks. Now how much space it wants to take even after it is stable and fixed. Means if you are in you office the you create a distance betwwen other employess to sit similary that outer space after the border is called margin

ADD IMAGE of brick and box model

Increase in padding  will increase the width and height because it will create space for inner text of the briks
Increasing the margin will not increase height and width but it will increase the sourounding space. So the bricks have lot of space get reserved for there outer surface
