Learn CSS in one look

# Why CSS ?
If you create a house then it will require to set the orientation, size, height, location and other appearnig feature of the rooms.
You will also require to decide that on which floor your room should be and what should be the color of the each wall.
So CSS is not only a painting thing it decideds the orientation and all appearing design of the indivisiual app elements like button, text box,  images and all the things you see in a app

# Can HTML not solve this problem
No, HTML is just like the skeleton of the house. You can just put rows of briks(HTML) one after one but to align it in perticular direction or to make it appear like small or tall or colourfull you need CSS
Without CSS the app will be like a pdf document having text in each new line
If you write list of things in new lines then you cannot make it to appear in a single line or vice versa but CSS will give you the power to play with the orientations, animation and colors.
